; If we do (ask person-part 'INSTALL) instead of (delegate person-part self â€™INSTALL))
;  it installs its own self (person-part) to the location (since ask will give the self as person-part to person,
;  which will return the install method from thing-part of mobile-thing-part, and that will install
;  the person-part to the location, not the autonomous person)
;  however the self of autonomous part also thinks it is in that location
;  This doesn't become a problem until it moves. When it moves,
;  it will ask its mobile-thing part to change location, which will try to delete the self (where self = autonomous person)
;  from the location, however there is no such thing (since only the player-thing part is in the location which != auto. person)
;  and will add the autonomous person to new location. Thus, the person is still in the first room since it didn't got deleted,
;  however the autonomous person is also in the second room since it got added to there

#|
The arguments, weapon? and damage methods are trivial
In hit, we assume person and target are persons, as if they are not, we will get an error in 'SUFFER (or maybe in 'NAME or 'LOCATION)
We first check whether the person and the target are in the same room, as otherwise, the person cannot attack the target
Then, we say to the room they are in that the person is attacking the target using this weapon
Then we calculate the damage as a random-number, which is between 1 and our max damage, and make the target suffer this much damage
Then we say to the room about the damage done in the attack

#|
Since violent player is an autonomous player, we take name, birthplace, activity and miserly as arguments
  and create the autonomous part (that is, inherit from it)
We also take an argument for violence frequency
The methods VIOLENT-PLAYER?, VIOLENCE-FREQUENCY are trivial
ATTACK-CHANCE returns the chance of attack in a tick (which is 1 / violence-frequency)
In INSTALL, like the autonomous player and troll classes, we add a callback to clock ticks, which is DECIDE-ATTACK
In DECIDE-ATTACK, we first get a random real number between 0 and 1 and check whether it is in range 0, ATTACK-CHANCE
  so that our character attacks with chance of ATTACK-CHANCE, thus have attack frequency of VIOLENCE-FREQUENCY/
  If we're attacking, we get the other people and weapons in the room, and if there is both another person
  and a weapon, we attack
In ATTACK, we attack the target using the weapon give
