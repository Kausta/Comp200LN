; If we do (ask person-part 'INSTALL) instead of (delegate person-part self â€™INSTALL))
;  it installs its own self (person-part) to the location (since ask will give the self as person-part to person,
;  which will return the install method from thing-part of mobile-thing-part, and that will install
;  the person-part to the location, not the autonomous person)
;  however the self of autonomous part also thinks it is in that location
;  This doesn't become a problem until it moves. When it moves,
;  it will ask its mobile-thing part to change location, which will try to delete the self (where self = autonomous person)
;  from the location, however there is no such thing (since only the player-thing part is in the location which != auto. person)
;  and will add the autonomous person to new location. Thus, the person is still in the first room since it didn't got deleted,
;  however the autonomous person is also in the second room since it got added to there

#|
The arguments, weapon? and damage methods are trivial
In hit, we assume person and target are persons, as if they are not, we will get an error in 'SUFFER (or maybe in 'NAME or 'LOCATION)
We first check whether the person and the target are in the same room, as otherwise, the person cannot attack the target
Then, we say to the room they are in that the person is attacking the target using this weapon
Then we calculate the damage as a random-number, which is between 1 and our max damage, and make the target suffer this much damage
Then we say to the room about the damage done in the attack

#|
Since violent player is an autonomous player, we take name, birthplace, activity and miserly as arguments
  and create the autonomous part (that is, inherit from it)
We also take an argument for violence frequency
The methods VIOLENT-PLAYER?, VIOLENCE-FREQUENCY are trivial
ATTACK-CHANCE returns the chance of attack in a tick (which is 1 / violence-frequency)
In INSTALL, like the autonomous player and troll classes, we add a callback to clock ticks, which is DECIDE-ATTACK
In DECIDE-ATTACK, we first get a random real number between 0 and 1 and check whether it is in range 0, ATTACK-CHANCE
  so that our character attacks with chance of ATTACK-CHANCE, thus have attack frequency of VIOLENCE-FREQUENCY/
  If we're attacking, we get the other people and weapons in the room, and if there is both another person
  and a weapon, we attack
In ATTACK, we attack the target using the weapon give

The methods other than trigger, heard noise, activate are trivial
Bomb has an aware part and a mobile part so that it listens to people moving into the room
  and it can be moved

When triggered, if it is armed, it explodes
When it hears a noise, i.e, someone enters the room
  then it first notices everyone if it is armed, so that others know who activated the bomb
  and then it triggers the bomb
When activated, (unless the bomb is armed, which shouldn't happen, so it is an error)
   it notices everyone in the room that the bomb is exploding, then it damages everyone in the room
   based on the power of the bomb,
   then it destroys itself

Bomb with timer is the version of bomb that activates a timer when triggered
Unless disarmed before the timer stops, it activates and damages everyone while destroying itself
It can be disarmed before exploding
Then timer stops and it resets its state
If it is not disarmed, then it ticks and reports remaning seconds until it explodes

#|
make-person-with-magicka creates a person with magicka, so it inherits person
    and has magicka related attributes, and appropriate getters for those attributes
  At install, it adds a callback for the magicka regen at each tick
  In suffer to soul, one receives magicka damage, it doesn't affect health, but decreases magicka
  In use magicka, if one has enough magicka, it uses it and returns true,
     if one doesn't have enough magicka, it reports it, doesn't use magicka and returns false

---

make-skill creates a skill with given name, magicka cost and effect
  It has getters for magicka cost and effect
  In cast, it checks if the caster is a person with magicka, and if it is not true, it damages
     the user as a mere person without magicka shouldn't cast spells, or even touch them at all
     Currently a user cannot learn spells, but can cast if the cast method is directly called with a user
     If the caster doesn't have enough magicka, he is notified but nothing happens
     If all conditions met, then the spell is cast

---

Fireball, manaburn, push-person are 3 generic predefined skill, more can be (and actually) defined in setup

- Fireball does damage and makes the user say Burn {Target}

- Manaburn does magicka damage to the target if the target has magicka, does nothing otherwise

- Push person pushes a person to a random exit in the current room, so the person is forced to change location

make-magician creates a magician, that inherits person with magicka, that can learn and use spelss
   It has a skill container for learned skills
   It has appropriate methods for the container, Skills, Knows Skill and Get Skill
     which returns all skills, checks whether the user knowns a skill from name and gets a skill object from name (in given order)
   Learn skill first checks whether the given object is a skill and reports otherwise
     It then checks whether the user already knowns the skill, and reports if he knows
     Then it adds the skill to the container
   Forget skill makes the person forget a skill from the name of the skill, and reports
     if the user doens't know the skill
   Use skill on casts the given spell (from name) on the target
     using the skills Cast method, if the user knows the skill, magicka usage
     is handled by the spell's Cast method.
     If the user doesn't know the skill, it just makes the person say i can't do that
   Use skill self casts the self on this person himself

make-magician-avatar creates a controllable avatar that is a magician
   Look around now also reports the known skills

make-autonomous-magician is an autonomous character, a NPC, that can learn and use magic
  It doesn't learn magic by itself, so it can only use spells he knows from start, or made learned
   by someone else, calling 'learn-skill on the character
  In install, it adds the timer for move and cast magic
  Unlike regular autonomous people, autonomous magician doens't pick stuff up, however
   the autonomous magicians are quite angry, and likes to cast magic so it casts magic
   every tick
  In move and cast magic, it casts the magic on self based on a probability (1/5),
    otherwise it casts it on a random target in the room
  If it doens't know a skill, or there is no target (and not casting on self), it casts a random
    magic it knowns to a random person in the room
